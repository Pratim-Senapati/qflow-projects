#üìÑ CORDIC-Based Sine and Cosine Generator Description
This project implements a CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm in Verilog to efficiently calculate the sine and cosine of a given input angle. The CORDIC algorithm is a hardware-friendly iterative method that performs vector rotations using only shift and add operations, making it highly efficient for FPGA and ASIC implementations.

##‚úÖ Key Features:
- Input:

	- `theta`: The input angle in radians, represented as a 16-bit fixed-point number.

	- `clk`: Clock signal for sequential operations.

	- `reset`: Resets the module.

- Output:

	- `sine`: Sine of the input angle (16-bit fixed-point format).

	- `cosine`: Cosine of the input angle (16-bit fixed-point format).

##‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Workflow:
1. Initialization:

	- The angle is compared against predefined arctangent values (look-up table).

2. Iterations:

	- The algorithm performs successive rotations by pre-defined angles using only shift and add operations.

	- The rotation either adds or subtracts the angle from the accumulated result, progressively refining the sine and cosine values.

3. Output:

	- The final sine and cosine values are generated in fixed-point format with 16-bit precision.

##üî• Usage:
- This module demonstrates fixed-point arithmetic, efficient trigonometric calculations, and iterative algorithms in Verilog.

##üìä Applications:
- **Digital signal processing (DSP):** Used in sine/cosine waveform generation, modulation and demodulation.

- **Communication systems:** For phase modulation, digital oscillators, and vector rotations.

- **Control systems:** For feedback loops, servo systems, and robotic motion control.
